Canvas submission includes:
 - report.pdf
 - monoVO.ipynb - Implements Monocular VO.
 - stereoVO_Hybrid.ipynb - Implements Stereo Hybrid Full sensitivity as described in report.pdf.
 - stereoVO_Global.ipynb - Implements Stereo Global sensitivities at subsampled point cloud sizes of 10k, 20k, and 50k as described in report.pdf.

Due to size of KITTI materials, we decided the best way to submit a functional implementation is to link to our Google Drive.  Google Colab notebooks are available for each of the three submitted notebooks.  The directory 'work_files' contains all development notebooks - they are a bit messy but include a great deal more experimentation and code than the clean, submitted notebooks.  To install the necessary packages, it may be necessary to install libraries and restart the notebook (quirk of Google Colab).
